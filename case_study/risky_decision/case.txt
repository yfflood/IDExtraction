Let us suppose that a chemical having some benefits is also suspected of possible carcinogenicity. We wish to determine whether to ban, restrict, or permit its use. The economic value of the product and the cancer cost attributed to it both depend on the decision regarding usage of the chemical. The economic value given the usage decision is independent of the human exposure, carcinogenic activity, and the cancer cost. However, the cancer cost is dependent on the usage decision as well as on both the carcinogenic activity and human exposure levels of the chemical. The net value of the chemical given the economic value and the cancer cost is independent of the other variables. Also, human exposure and carcinogenic activity are independent.
