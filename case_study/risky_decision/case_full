Let us suppose that a chemical having some benefits is also suspected of possible carcinogenicity. We wish to determine whether to ban, restrict, or permit its use, and also whether to undertake any information gathering regarding cancer-producing activity of the chemical or its degree of exposure to humans. 
The economic value of the product and the cancer cost attributed to it both depend on the decision regarding usage of the chemical. The (probability assignment on) economic value given the usage decision is independent of the human exposure, carcinogenic activity, and the cancer cost. However, the cancer cost is dependent on the usage decision as well as on both the carcinogenic activity and human exposure levels of the chemical. The net value of the chemical given the economic value and the cancer cost is independent of the other variables. Also, human exposure and carcinogenic activity are independent.
The usage decision alternatives are BAN, RESTRICT, and PERMIT. The economic value given each of these alternatives are as follows: the permit alternative is considered to have a reference value of zero, the restrict alternative a substitute process cost of 1 million, and the ban alternative a substitute process cost of 5 million. 
Human exposure is low with (unconditional) probability 0.5, medium with probability 0.45, and high with probabiility 0.05. Carcinogenic activity is inactive with probability 0.5, moderate with probability 0.4 and very active with probability 0.1.
The cancer cost is 0 if BAN alternative is chosen, or if carcinogenic activity is inactive. Otherwise, increasing exposure from low to medium or medium to high increases canser cost 10 times. Increasing carcinogenic activity from moderate to very active increases cancer cost 20 times. The cost when exposure is low and activity is moderate is 0.5. Cancer cost of any composition of alternative chosen, exposure level and carcinogenic activity can be derived thereafter.
