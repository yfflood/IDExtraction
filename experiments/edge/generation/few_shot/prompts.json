All conditions and variables should be members of the list: {node_list}. \n\nA few examples are provided as follows: \n\nGiven nodes cold weather and respiratory diseases, there should be an edge, where cold weather is the condition, and respiratory diseases is the variable. When condition cold weather is present, the probability of respiratory diseases occuring is high; the rationale is then transformed into a nested dictionary.\n\nGiven nodes cloudy weather and rain, there should be an edge, where cloudy weather is the condition, and rain is the variable. When condition cloudy weather is present, the probability of rain occuring is high; the rationale is then transformed into a nested dictionary.\n\nGiven nodes road condition and customer route choice, there should be an edge, where road condition is the condition, and customer route choice is the variable. When condition road condition is good, the probability of customer route choice being choosing this route is high, equivalently, the probability of the variable being not choosing this route is low; the rationale is then transformed into a nested dictionary.\n\nOutput using the following format:\n{format_instructions}\n\nThe content should be in Chinese if the text is in Chinese."
