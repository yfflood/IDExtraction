When condition cloudy weather is present, the probability of rain occuring is high; the rationale is then transformed into a nested dictionary.\n\nGiven nodes road condition and customer route choice, in the sentence \nIn day-to-day life, customer route choice is significantly influenced by road conditions.\nthere should be an edge, where road condition is the condition, and customer route choice is the variable. When condition road condition is good, the probability of customer route choice being choosing this route is high, equivalently, the probability of the variable being not choosing this route is low; the rationale is then transformed into a nested dictionary.\n\nOutput using the following format: \n{format_instructions}\n\nThe content should be in Chinese if the text is in Chinese.\n\ntext: {text}"
